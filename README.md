# TODO
Assets & Budgets management (granular data entry such as amount of lights, amount of cars, etc. to allow for full management), and also give advice on how to reduce emissions, other than just buying more credits

## Backend
- Firstly, implement auth and organization system (betterauth / clerk / stytch) to allow multiple organizations to use the platform
Allow for additional database storage for the granular amount of data entry, there might also be a way to store specific formula that is needed for granular calculation
- Maybe add additional web scraping or data fetching technique that can allow automatic update/fetch of information needed for all sort of calculations (browserless or alternative, headless web scraping platform)

## Marketing
Professional Consultant that can check the data monthly
